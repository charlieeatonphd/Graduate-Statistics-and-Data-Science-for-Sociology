# DataHub Replication Package Final Assignment

### Soc 211 Graduate Statistics and Data Science for Sociology, Professor Charlie Eaton

Due 5pm, Tuesday May 7th by submitting a link to the repository in CatCourses.

This culminating assignment for the course is to publish a replication package at the Higher Ed DataHub. A model replication package is here: https://github.com/HigherEdData/The-For-Profit-Side-of-Public-U/tree/main

20% of the replication package grade will be based on whether the code files replicate successfully when executed by the course TA and instructor. You will also receive 10% of your grade for the assignment for doing each of the following 8 things. The replication package should:
1. Use the directory structure, file organization, and file naming conventions of the DataHub for your replication package. The conventions are explained here: https://github.com/HigherEdData

2. Include a c_data_download.ipynb notebook that downloads, merges, and saves any data you are using.

3. Include a "Table 1" t1_variable_definitions.ipynb Notebook that reports variable names and definitions (by writing variable defitions within Stata variable labels and then using the describe command to report all variable names and their labels in the notebook)

4. Include a "Table 2" t2_descriptive_stats.ipynb Notebook that reports means and standard deviations for all of your covariates along with N sample sizes for your data. Use the stata table and collect export commands to output the descriptive stats within the notebook and in a word document. 

5. Include a "Table 3" t3_regression_estimates.ipynb Notebook that reports estimates of OLS or logit regression results with at least sets of coefficients for different model specifications.

6. Include at least one figure notebook with the f1_figure.ipynb title that produces and saves a .pdf version of a data visualization. The visualization could be a time series line graph, a scatterplot with a fitted line, boxplots of key variables, a bar chart, or a marginsplot of regression adjusted means for different categories in your analysis.

7. Include a README.md file that has a title for your study and a short abstract explaining your research question. The README.md file should also explain your file organization structure. 

8. The replication package should be published in a repository for the DataHub organization. You can create the repository by followint these instructions: https://docs.github.com/en/migrations/importing-source-code/using-the-command-line-to-import-source-code/adding-locally-hosted-code-to-github
